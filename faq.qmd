### Can I bring my children to the wedding?

Do you have a tiny little baby? Under 1 year old? Please bring the baby if you'd like. Let us know when you RSVP.

Due to the limited capacity of the venue we are unable to accommodate older children at our event. 

For out of town guests, we are considering multiple options for childcare. If you are interested in this, please email us! [siobhankyle2016@gmail.com](mailto:siobhankyle2016@gmail.com)

### Can I bring a guest or plus one?

Due to limited event space, only the adults listed on the invitation will be able to attend.

### What is the setting of the wedding?

The wedding will be outside in an orchard. The ceremony and cocktail hour will be in full sun, but we will have fans and some parasols. We recommend sunscreen!

### What else should we know about the venue?

The bathrooms are in mobile trailers! 

There is another venue called The Orchard nearby. We are not getting married there! We are at Mt. View Orchards. 

### What is the dress code?

Semi-formal. Color recommended! Do you have a linen suit you've always wanted to wear? Now's the time. No ties are necessary, at the groom's request. 

Please avoid colors traditionally reserved for the bride, like white and ivory. 

### Where can I park?

There is ample parking at the venue. You cannot park there overnight.

If you would like to take the shuttle from Hood River, please park at the Holiday Inn Express & Suites Hood River. 

### How can I get to the wedding?

If you are staying at either of the hotels we have a room block at, a shuttle will pick you up. 

You can also head to either of the shuttle pick up spots. Parking is easier at the Holiday Inn, but the Hood River Hotel is more centrally located in downtown Hood River. 

### What time should I arrive to the wedding?

Doors open at 3 pm and the bar will be open. Come and enjoy a cocktail with the bride and groom before the ceremony!

The ceremony will begin promptly at 4 pm.
