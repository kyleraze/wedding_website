The closest airport to the wedding venue is Portland International Airport (PDX). It is a one-hour drive from the airport to Hood River, and a further 20 minutes to the wedding venue.

### Flights into Portland

We recommend that you **book your flights early**. Oregon is a big tourist destination in the Summer, and flights can get expensive, or "spendy" as the locals might say. 

- JetBlue and Alaska Airlines offer direct flights from Boston Logan to PDX.
- If you are flying from across the pond, there are direct flights to PDX from London Heathrow, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, and Keflavik, Iceland. There are also direct flights from Dublin to some other West Coast cities, including an Aer Lingus route to Seattle.
- Are you looking for a deal? We recommend checking first for connecting flights through bigger West Coast hubs like Los Angeles (LAX), San Francisco, Seattle, or Vancouver, BC.
