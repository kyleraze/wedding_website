We recommend that you take the earliest shuttle you can. Why?

- The party starts when you get there! Translation: **open bar**.
- The ceremony starts promptly at 4pm.

Shuttles will start at the Holiday Inn and then pick up more guests at the Hood River Hotel as space allows. The route follows winding country roads, so if you are sensitive to that please take precautions. You should expect a 25 minute ride from Hood River to the venue.

### From the Holiday Inn Express

- 1:50pm pickup: 56 passenger motorcoach
- 2:20pm pickup: 14 passenger van

### From the Hood River Hotel

- 2:10pm pickup: 56 passenger motorcoach
- 2:35pm pickup: 14 passenger van
- 3:20pm pickup: 56 passenger motorcoach
    - **This final pickup may be skipped if all guests are already at the wedding!**

### From the wedding to Hood River

- 7:15pm early pickup (wedding ends at 9pm): 56-passenger motorcoach
- 8:45pm pickup: Shuttles will be ready to take you to the **AFTER PARTY** at the Oak Street Pub, the Holiday Inn Express, or the Hood River Hotel
