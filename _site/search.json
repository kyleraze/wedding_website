    "text": "A work in progress\nThe closest airport to the wedding venue is Portland International Airport (PDX). It is a one-hour drive from the airport to Hood River, and a further 20 minutes to the wedding venue.\n\nFlights into Portland\nWe recommend that you book your flights early. Oregon is a big tourist destination in the Summer, and flights can get expensive, or “spendy” as the locals might say.\n\nJetBlue and Alaska Airlines offer direct flights from Boston Logan to PDX.\nIf you are flying from across the pond, there are direct flights to PDX from London Heathrow, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, and Keflavik, Iceland. There are also direct flights from Dublin to some other West Coast cities, including an Aer Lingus route to Seattle.\nAre you looking for a deal? We recommend checking first for connecting flights through bigger West Coast hubs like Los Angeles (LAX), San Francisco, Seattle, or Vancouver, BC.\n\n\nFlight discounts\nGroup discounts  The Coens love to travel in a horde, so why not save some money? If 10 or more of you are planning to travel on the same flights, you can get a discount. To arrange with Alaska Airlines call 1-800-445-4435; with JetBlue fill out the form at the bottom of this webpage.\nIndividual discounts  If you are flying on Alaska Airlines to and from PDX, we have a discount code* you can use to book directly with the airline. This entitles you to 5% off your flight from select airports. Details to follow.\n\n\n\nFrom Portland to Hood River\nRenting a car offers you the most convenience, but if you would like to avoid renting a car you have some options.\n\n\nFrom Hood River to the venue\nWe will be offering shuttles from the Holiday Inn and the Hood River Hotel."

The ceremony and cocktail hour will be in full sun, but we will have fans and some parasols.
