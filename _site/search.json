    "text": "The closest airport to the wedding venue is Portland International Airport (PDX). It is a one-hour drive from the airport to Hood River, and a further 20 minutes to the wedding venue.\n\nFlights into Portland\nWe recommend that you book your flights early. Oregon is a big tourist destination in the Summer, and flights can get expensive, or “spendy” as the locals might say.\n\nJetBlue and Alaska Airlines offer direct flights from Boston Logan to PDX.\nIf you are flying from across the pond, there are direct flights to PDX from London Heathrow, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, and Keflavik, Iceland. There are also direct flights from Dublin to some other West Coast cities, including an Aer Lingus route to Seattle.\nAre you looking for a deal? We recommend checking first for connecting flights through bigger West Coast hubs like Los Angeles (LAX), San Francisco, Seattle, or Vancouver, BC.\n\n\n\nFrom Portland to Hood River\nRenting a car offers you the most convenience, but if you would like to avoid renting a car you have some options.\n\n\nFrom Hood River to the venue\nWe will be offering shuttles from the Holiday Inn and the Hood River Hotel."

    "text": "Can I bring my children to the wedding?\nDo you have a tiny little baby? Under 1 year old? Please bring the baby if you’d like.

Please email us (siobhankyle2016@gmail.com) if you are interested in this!\n\n\nCan I bring a guest or plus-one?\nDue to limited event space, only the adults listed on the invitation will be able to attend.\n\n\nWhat is the setting of the wedding?\nThe wedding will be outside in an orchard.
