The ceremony and cocktail hour will be in full sun, but we will have fans and some parasols. We recommend sunscreen!\n\n### What else should we know about the venue?\n\nThe bathrooms are in mobile trailers! \n\nThere is another venue called The Orchard nearby. We are not getting married there! We are at Mt. View Orchards. \n\n### What is the dress code?\n\nSemi-formal. Color recommended! Do you have a linen suit you've always wanted to wear? Now's the time. No ties are necessary, at the groom's request. \n\nPlease avoid colors traditionally reserved for the bride, like white and ivory. \n\n### Where can I park?\n\nThere is ample parking at the venue. You cannot park there overnight.\n\nIf you would like to take the shuttle from Hood River, please park at the Holiday Inn Express & Suites Hood River. \n\n### How can I get to the wedding?\n\nIf you are staying at either of the hotels we have a room block at, a shuttle will pick you up. \n\nYou can also head to either of the shuttle pick up spots.
